In this project, we created a digital piano with four customized preset songs utilizing AVRC programming and a SIPO shift register to create an automated system for our 32-key piano. We have used two sets of relays, both in parallel and connected in series allowing for specific note calling in our circuit. The relays are activated via a protocol that communicates with the shift register, triggering the mechanical switch relays to complete the circuit and produce an output through the designated speakers.
